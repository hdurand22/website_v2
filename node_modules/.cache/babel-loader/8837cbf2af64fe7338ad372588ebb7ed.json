We illustrate these techniques with exemplar games identified through consultation with experts. This analysis yields four key recommendations for designing diversity across a range of game platforms: match diversity affordances to player needs; draw strengths from both the digital and non-digital realms; design for conversation; and consider player diversity.

We introduce critical race theory and adapt it for HCI to lay a theoretical basis for race-conscious efforts, both in research and within our community. Building on the theory\\'s original tenets, we argue that racism is pervasive in everyday socio-technical systems; that the HCI community is prone to \"interest convergence\", where concessions to inclusion require benefits to those in power; and that the neoliberal underpinnings of the technology industry itself propagate racism. Critical race theory uses storytelling as a means to upend deep-seated assumptions, and we relate several personal stories to highlight ongoing problems of race in HCI. The implications: all HCI research must be attuned to issues of race; participation of underrepresented minorities must be sought in all of our activities; and as a community, we cannot become comfortable while racial disparities exist.',thumbnailImage:require('./thumbnails/pic02.jpg'),thumbnailImageDescription:'A colorful gradient placeholder',image:require('./images/pic02.jpg'),imageDescription:'A colorful gradient placeholder',media:[{mediaLink:'https://sites.google.com/view/raceinhci',mediaLinkTitle:'raceinhci.com',mediaLinkDescription:'Learn more and join our growing community of HCI researchers interested in race on Slack by visiting',mediaLinkInfo:null}],publications:[{name:'Critical Race Theory for HCI.',authors:'Ogbonnaya-Ogburu, I.

We illustrate these techniques with exemplar games identified through consultation with experts. This analysis yields four key recommendations for designing diversity across a range of game platforms: match diversity affordances to player needs; draw strengths from both the digital and non-digital realms; design for conversation; and consider player diversity.

Critical race theory uses storytelling as a means to upend deep-seated assumptions, and we relate several personal stories to highlight ongoing problems of race in HCI.
